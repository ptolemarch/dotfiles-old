#   Discussion
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# I wonder whether it's overkill to build the PATH programmatically, but I'm
# going to do it anyway.
#
# The argument for "overkill" goes as follows:
#  - If an item is not present, it'll just be skipped and ignored by the shell.
#  - If on the other hand the item is present, presumably it should be used,
#    and in the order given, right?
# For example: On my work server, I want to include early in my PATH the proper
# perl binary to use:
#   /opt/perl/perls/perl-5.28.1/bin/
# but since this directory isn't present on, for example, my work laptop, it
# does no harm there. And what if it were present? Presmably it would still be
# the perl I'd want to run, right?
#
# But, no, I don't think that follows, now that I think on it further. Indeed,
# I could even imagine having accounts on multiple work machines, each of which
# possibly requiring a different path to its preferred perl, yet having the
# un-preferred perls installed. I'm not saying this is likely, but it's
# entirely possible.
#
# The situation that makes me think this is worthwhile, though, is that of
# Termux on Android. There, the entire system is installed in a subdirectory,
# the location of which is given in the $PREFIX environment variable. For
# example, vim is located at $PREFIX/bin/vim. If we're not in Termux, $PREFIX
# would be empty or, worse, could mean something else entirely. In this
# particular case, adding $PREFIX/bin to my path would just mean, if $PREFIX is
# empty, that /bin appears twice in the path, probably one right after the
# other. That is, it wouldn't cause much trouble. But still.

# Since I'm going to be replacing the PATH, not adding to it, let's
# encode the default path, and then check it here. Report to the user
# if it's different since last we looked.
